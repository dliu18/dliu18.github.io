%%%{\bf Emulation infrastructure for mobile apps \hfill  Feb 2011 to May 2012} \\
%%%\textit{Guide: Dr. Li-Shiuan Peh} \\
%%%For my Masters thesis (\url {http://web.mit.edu/anirudh/www/sm-thesis.pdf}), I attempted to build a software system to help researchers evaluate collaborative mobile apps, at scale, more repeatably. A major problem with collaborative mobile apps today is that evaluations are limited to small deployments. By replacing physical deployments with software emulation, we hope to scale evaluations to a larger number of virtual phones. This infrastructure will be capable of evaluating both cloud-based and P2P mobile applications.

%%%{\bf Research Intern,} \textbf{Microsoft Reseach India} \hfill  \textbf{Summer 2010} \\
%%%\textbf{Measuring Energy consumption of Desktops in a corporate environment} \\
%%%\textit{Guides: Dr. Krishna Chintalapudi and Dr. Ranjita Bhagwan} \\
%%%I worked on Kelvin, an umbrella project that explores novel ways of profiling energy usage in a building. In an extension of my work from the previous summer, I focused on measuring Desktop energy usage in a corporate setting by building linear power consumption models for Desktops based on CPU and disk utilization. 
%%%\item 
%%%{\bf Research Intern,} \textbf{Microsoft Research India} \hfill  \textbf{Summer 2009} \\
%%%\textbf{Non-intrusive profiling of energy consumption in buildings} \\
%%%\textit{Guide: Dr. Krishna Chintalapudi } \\
%%% Fine grained profiling of energy usage in buildings can enable a host of energy efficient applications. In this project, I explored the use of sensor networks to enable fine grained energy profiling in a non intrusive manner. Specifically, I investigated the use of sensor motes based on the MSP430 processor, for estimating the power consumption of the HVAC system from temperature measurements.

%{\bf BTech Project,} \textbf{IIT Madras} \hfill \textbf{August 2009-May 2010} \\
%\textbf{Delay Tolerant Network Routing in Open Terrains} \\
%\textit{Guide: Dr. C Siva Ram Murthy }\\
%Conventional models of routing in a delay tolerant network (DTN) assume a closed terrain where the number of nodes in a given simulation area is invariant with time. I studied the implications that an open terrain, where there is continuous churn, has on routing in DTNs. This work was published in ICDCN 2011.

%\item 
%{\bf Software Engineering Project,} \textbf{IIT Madras} \hfill  \textbf{January-May 2009 }\\
% I worked on a project, under Prof D Janakiram of IIT Madras, to design and implement a middleware for wireless sensor networks as a group of four as part of my Software Engineering project. The middleware was to be service oriented and supported the basic operations of find, bind and execute. A report of the same is available at: \\

%\item 
%{\bf Research Intern,} \textbf{Nanyang Technological University} \hfill \textbf{Summer 2007} \\
%\textbf{Efficient segmentation of noisy iris images} \\
%\textit{Guide : Dr. Sudha Natarajan }\\
% I came up with an efficient implementation of the Iris segmentation algorithm proposed by John Daugman\footnote{High confidence visual recognition of persons by a test of statistical independence, JG Daugman, Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence Volume 15 Issue 11, November 1993} for comparison against new algorithms for noisy images being developed at the Center for Information Security at NTU.  This work was published in the Elsevier Signal, Image and Video Processing journal. The source code for my implementation is available at: \\ \url{http://www.mathworks.fr/matlabcentral/fileexchange/15652}
