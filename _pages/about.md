I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University, in affiliation with the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). 
My research interests are fairness in machine learning, computational social science, and computational reproducibility. I apply machine learning to social issues but am also interested in identifying and measuring its limitations. In the process, I draw on domain knowledge and software-engineering best practices.

Previously, I was a software engineer at Bloomberg LP where my work focused on full-stack C++ applications, message queueing, and continuous integration. Prior to Bloomberg, I graduated from Princeton University with a concentration in Computer Science and a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning. There, I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Matthew Salganik](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/) and wrote a senior thesis titled [Successes and struggles with computational reproducibility: Lessons from the Fragile Families Challenge](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g3pdb/).

In November 2019, I co-delivered the keynote address at the [RabbitMQ Summit](https://rabbitmqsummit.com/) in London. The talk is titled: "Growing a farm of rabbits to scale financial applications". A recording is available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/tTh1nIKEOU4?t=1216).
