I am a software engineer at Bloomberg LP where my work focuses on full-stack C++ applications, message queueing, and continuous integration. Prior to Bloomberg, I gradauted from Princeton University with a concentration in Computer Science and a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning. There, I was advised by Matthew Salganik and wrote a senior thesis titled [Successes and struggles with computational reproducibility: Lessons from the Fragile Families Challenge](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g3pdb/).
