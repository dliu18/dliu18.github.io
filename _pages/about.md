I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University, in affiliation with the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/), advised by Professor [Tina Eliassi-Rad](http://eliassi.org/). 
My research interests lie at the intersection of graph machine learning, algorithmic fairness, and the societal impact of AI. I apply machine learning to social issues but am also interested in identifying and measuring its limitations. I am supported by the NSF GRFP (2021-2024).

I graduated from Princeton University with a concentration in Computer Science and a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning. There, I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Matthew Salganik](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/).

During Summer 2022, I interned at Meta AI under the supervision of [Maximilian Nickel](https://ai.facebook.com/people/maximilian-nickel/) researching demographic-free measures of group fairness using social networks. Previously, I was a software engineer at Bloomberg LP where my work focused on full-stack C++ applications, message queueing, and continuous integration. 

*Update*: During Fall 2022, I am a visiting graduate student at the Simons Institute / UC Berkeley in the [Program on Graph Limits and Processes on Networks: From Epidemics to Misinformation](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/graph2022).
