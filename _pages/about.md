I am a fourth-year computer science Ph.D. candidate in [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University, in affiliation with the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/), advised by Professor [Tina Eliassi-Rad](http://eliassi.org/). 
My research interests lie at the intersection of graph machine learning, algorithmic fairness, and the societal impact of AI. My research is supported by the NSF GRFP.

I graduated from Princeton University with a concentration in Computer Science and a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning. There, I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Matthew Salganik](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/).

During Summer 2022, I interned at Meta AI under the supervision of [Maximilian Nickel](https://ai.facebook.com/people/maximilian-nickel/). Previously, I was a software engineer at Bloomberg LP where my work focused on full-stack C++ applications, message queueing, and continuous integration.
