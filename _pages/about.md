I am an [Assistant Research Professor](https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu/professorship-program/) at Cornell's Center for Data Science for Enterprise and Society, where I am mentored by Jon Kleinberg and Moon Duchin. I am affiliated with the Department of Computer Science.
 
My research interests lie at the intersection of graph machine learning, algorithmic fairness, and the societal impact of AI. I seek to improve the ability of machine learning models to capture the preferences and identities of minority populations.   

I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at Northeastern University, affiliated with the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/), where I was advised by Professor [Tina Eliassi-Rad](http://eliassi.org/). I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Engineering from Princeton University.

I have worked as a research-scientist intern at Meta (Central Applied Science and FAIR AI), sociotechnical researcher at [Taraaz](https://taraazresearch.org/), and software engineer at Bloomberg LP.
